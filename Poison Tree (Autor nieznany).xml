    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>This tree bears strange fruit<br/>There's blood on the leaves, it's dead at the root<br/>The cracked grey branches are decaying within<br/>Just like the black poison that hangs from it's limbs</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I tried to tie good fruit<br/>To a tree that had poison all the way through<br/>It rotted and fell off, it was dead to the core<br/>It even killed the ground, I was worse than before</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>You can't tie fresh fruit<br/>To a tree that has poison all the way through<br/>It will rot and will fall off and soon it will die<br/>It will even kill the ground, It's a matter of time</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines break="optional">Come and dig me up, reach down to the root<br/>Rip the deadness out, and plant something (completely) new<br/><br/>I am alive, I will abide<br/>In the life giving blood of Christ</lines>
      <lines>Come and dig me up, reach down to the root<br/>Rip the deadness out, and plant something (completely) new<br/><br/>I am alive, I will abide<br/>In the life giving blood of Christ</lines>
